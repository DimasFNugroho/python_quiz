## Features

- **Interactive Console UI**: Navigate through the application using a clean menu system powered by `ncurses`.
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate and update Python-related quiz questions.
- **Customizable Question Bank**: Add, edit, delete, or regenerate questions with ease.
- **Bulk Regeneration**: Refresh all questions in the database with new, paraphrased contexts.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks and displays your quiz score with real-time feedback for correct and incorrect answers.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize the application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (place it in `api_key.txt`)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimasFNugroho/python_quiz.git
cd python_quiz
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. **Add Your OpenAI API Key**:
   - Create a file named `api_key.txt` in the root directory.
   - Paste your OpenAI API key into the file.

   Example:
   ```plaintext
   sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

2. **Question Database**:
   - Questions are stored in `intro_python.json`.
   - You can pre-populate the file with your own questions or let the app generate them dynamically.

## Usage

### Run the Application

```bash
python3 intro_python_curses.py
```

### Menu Options

1. **Take the Quiz**:
